# grep

The grep command in Unix/Linux is a powerful tool used for searching and manipulating text patterns within files.

```cmd
grep [options] pattern [files]
```
options = These are command-line flags that modify the behavior of grep. 
pattern = This is the regular expression you want to search for.
file = This is the name of the file(s) you want to search within. You can specify multiple files for simultaneous searching.
